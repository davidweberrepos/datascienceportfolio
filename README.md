# Data Science Portfolio

This repository represents some of my data science projects that I did in my freetime - often to learn new skills, domains and libraries.
More to come - currently, I am focused on my master's thesis and work.

## Project Overview:
Projects mostly contain an explorative data analysis (EDA) and sometimes modelling with different libraries.
* [Python for Data Analysis by *Wes McKinney*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/): Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib
* [Introduction to CNNs with Tensorflow and Keras](/02_tensorflow_keras_intro): CNNs, Training and Prediction
* Timeseries: Australian Drug Sales: EDA
* Timeseries: Germany's Energy Consumption: EDA and Time Modelling with FB-Prophet
* Hote Cancellation Data: EDA and Feature Engineering
* Titanic Dataset: EDA
* Wine Quality: Using R for descriptive Data Analysis

I plan on extending my data science project portfolio with further machine learning, deep learning and big data (Spark, Hadoop) projects.
